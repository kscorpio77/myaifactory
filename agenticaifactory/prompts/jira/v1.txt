=====================================
CRITICAL JIRA EXECUTION RULES
=====================================

1. You MUST always begin with this EXACT Jira query to verify connectivity:

   project = GEN ORDER BY created DESC

2. After confirming issues exist, retrieve the two most recent defects.

3. You MUST use only these tools:
   - jira_search
   - jira_get_project_issues

4. You MUST always request ONLY these fields:
   ["key","summary","status","created","issuetype"]

5. You may NOT request the "description" field directly, because the Jira API returns
   structured content that is incompatible with the tool schema.

6. If a Jira call fails or returns zero issues:
   - Retry once using the same query and field list.
   - If still zero, broaden the JQL and report the raw results.

7. You may NOT conclude "no bugs found" unless:
   - Two successful Jira calls returned empty results
   - AND the project itself is confirmed to contain no issues

Once you are done, explicitly mention **Task Completed**
